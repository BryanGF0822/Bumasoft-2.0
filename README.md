# What's Bumasoft about?
Buma is a software created to facilitate the generation and management of residential units, which is ableto adapt to any type of residence regardless of the number
of buildings, parking spaces, gates, etc. 
In addition, it is also able to guide visitors through the shortest way to the apartment to be visited and because the parking areas are not exclusive, the program is
able to indicate the free parking space that is closest to your apartment so that leaving the residence is more comfortable.
